'''
A language model is a model which understands language â€“ more precisely how words occur together in natural language.
A language model is used to predict what word comes next.
The building and training of models is both complex and resource intensive. Luckily, there are pre-trained language models.
A couple of factors to consider when choosing a pre-trained language model:
    What task are you using it for?
    What are the technical requirements to use the model?
baseWindow - the main GUI window that contains everything
chatWindow - displays the conversation between a user and the chatbot
userEntryBox - for the user to type their queries for the Chatbot
sendButton - a button that sends the user query to the Chatbot
send() - collects the user input from the userEntryBox, gets the bot_response
create_and_insert_user_frame() - inserts the user_input into the chatWindow
create_and_insert_bot_frame() - inserts the bot response into the chatWindow
